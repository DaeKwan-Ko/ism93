#The scripts provided in this repository allows to analyze raw (fastq.qz) data for whole genome sequencing analysis presented in our paper (under review):

"The ubiquitin-proteosome system acts as pro-death factors downstream of IRE1 in the UPR"

"bsa/" folder contains scripts for quality control, mapping, variant calling and bulk segregation analysis. I used the following versions of the programs: FastQC (version 0.11.5), Cutadapt (version 1.8.1), Bowtie (version 2.2.3), Samtools (version 1.8), bcftools (version 1.9.64), SHOREmap (version 3.6).
